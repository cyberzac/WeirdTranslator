The WeirdTranslator is an exercise in using Scala with Apache Camel.
It will connect to  GTalk via XMPP as well as starting a socket server on
port 6666. Then it will translate all incoming messages to italian, polish,
german, french, spanish and then back to the original language.

You need:
*  Scala 2.8.1
*  SBT

To run you need to give three arguments the GTalk user, toUser,  to send messages
to and the GTalk user, fromUser, and password to send messages from.
When running you can either send messages from the GTalk toUser and
have them translated. Or you can connect to the socket server on port 6666
and type the messages directly.
